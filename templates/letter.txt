Hello,

I am a 3rd year student pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at Indian School of Mines(ISM), Dhanbad. I am writing to apply for summer internship at <%= email.company %> as an Android Application Developer or Backend Developer.

Previously I have worked as an Android Application Developer intern at Scribbler Notebooks, Bangalore during May-June 2015. Also I have an app in Google Play Store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=architect.jazzy.medicinereminder).

Being a fresher, I am searching for opportunities to learn. Working with you would be a great opportunity for me to learn aspects of working in an organization.
